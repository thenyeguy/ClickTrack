ClickTrackForAndroid
====================

A simple audio processing and MIDI framework in C++. Ported to Android as
a native library.

The mainline for ClickTrack for Android is a branch in the mainline ClickTrack
repository, titled `android-master`. It includes all C++ code and ndk build
information for the native portion, but no Java wrapper.

Changes will be synchronized by Michael Nye between `master` and
`android-master`.
